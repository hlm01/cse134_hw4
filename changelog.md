## Third party JavaScript

-   Installed google analytics script tag to my website
-   I chose to install this script because I think it would be useful to gain insight into visitors of my website and help to learn about possible improvements based on their experiences. It can possibly help me learn about where the users are from, how they interact with the website, parts of the website that are being focused on or not getting any attention. This way, data about the users can be used as feedback in the user centered design process and act as another source to base decisions off of.
